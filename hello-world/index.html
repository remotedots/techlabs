		About Rotterdam

		<!-- paragraph -->
		Known as the “gateway to Europe” due to its large seaport, Rotterdam is a cultural melting pot with over 170 nationalities. Famous for its modern architecture as well as inventing ‘Kapsalon’, Rotterdam is home to many internationally renowned knowledge institutions and universities. With so much diversity, innovation and know-how in one place, it’s no wonder this city is developing into a major European tech & start-up hub with more than 500 tech start-ups (and counting). We believe Rotterdam is one of the best places to enter the Tech World– independent of your prior knowledge.
